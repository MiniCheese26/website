    <h1>Support Us</h1>
    <p>Membership of Portsmouth Cycle Forum is free, because we want to encourage as many cyclists as we can to engage with our campaign. However, any campaign has some costs and the cycle forum is no different. If you’d like to make a donation to support our campaign we would very, very much appreciate your generosity. This will help us to cover costs such as printing, postage, event fees and web-related fees.</p>
<p>You can use the cards below to make a donation to us via Sumup using any credit or debit card. If you click on the image below you can choose to make a donation of the amount you are comfortable with as a one-off donation. We understand that money is tight and we genuinely appreciate every penny.</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>
