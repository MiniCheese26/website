  <h1>COASTAL CYCLING: PCF RESPONSES TO COUNCIL PLANS</h1>
  <p>There’s been a lot going on lately with three major consultations for us to respond to, so of course we’ve been kept pretty busy in making sure we know all the details, lobbying to make sure the planners keep cycling in mind.</p>
<p>1. Seafront Sea Defences<br>This is the consultation on the design of the sea defences which sets the parameters for future cycling infrastructure, although it doesn’t commit to any details. You can see more details in our previous post <a href="http://www.printsink.co.uk/pcf/2019/02/seafront-cycling-action-needed-now-now-now/">here</a>. We weren’t very happy with this report because, as it stands, it effectively bans cycling along Southsea Esplanade in one direction as cycling infrastructure has given way to parallel parking. We’re assured that this isn’t the final design and that we’ll be involved in future discussions. One to keep a close eye on. Y</p>
<p>2. Seafront masterplan<br>This is the consultation on the aspirations for the seafront in the future and will become a supplementary planning document (SPD) that developers planning to build anything in the area will be required to reflect in their plans. You can see more details in our previous post <a href="http://www.printsink.co.uk/pcf/2019/02/seafront-cycling-action-needed-now-now-now/">here</a>. This report is fantastic! It promises a ferry to ferry cycle route segregated from motor vehicles and pedestrians – bliss! However, it will be impossible to deliver if the sea defences don’t provide enough space.</p>
<p>3. Tipner<br>This is the consultation on future plans for Horsea and Tipner and includes houses, businesses and…a bus, cycle and car (access only bridge) between the two, providing a huge shortcut between Port Solent and Tipner. Our response to this is mixed – the report as it is focuses mainly on motor vehicle access and we’ll be following progress to ensure that the amazing opportunities for walking and cycling in this location are taken up right from the start of development.</p>
<p>Our responses to all three documents (attached) follow feedback from our members, and engagement with council officers through meetings and attending official consultation events.
