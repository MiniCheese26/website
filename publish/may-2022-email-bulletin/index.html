<p><strong>Portsmouth Cycle Forum ride to Gosport Sunday 12th June 11am</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Join us for a cycle over to Gosport, and the Powder Monkey brewery at Priddy&#39;s Hard. Meet 11am Victoria Park by the birds in the middle.</strong>   Open to all, this will be a leisurely paced ride with two options ; one longer (via Portchester and Fareham) and one shorter, via the Gosport ferry. You can choose either route to get home again but remember to bring money for the ferry if you want to take it.</p>
<p>Lunch and drinks are available to buy at Powder Monkey, but kiddies are welcome to bring a picnic if that&#39;s easier. There&#39;s space to put down a picnic blanket and have a run around. If it&#39;s raining, we&#39;ll have lunch inside before heading back, so do bring a bike lock with you.</p>
<p>Other than the ferry, the ride is being provided for free, but donations to help keep us afloat are always welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Active Travel - The Art of the Possible</strong></p>
<p>We often talk about creating #ACityToShare.  But how can it be done and what would it look like?</p>
<p>The Netherlands is often cited as the place to visit and experience the difference in culture, but increasing UK cities are producing infrastructure and schemes that outline approaches to follow.</p>
<p>In the linked video Liverpool City Region Walking and Cycling Commissioner Simon O&#39;Brien looks at the possibilities around Active Travel. <a href="https://pompeybug.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2ed916007f1c294faa614a50f&id=dca0ac41bc&e=d6f4bfca9e">Watch the</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5om1yL7Jxaw&ab_channel=LiverpoolCityRegionCombinedAuthority">You Tube Video</a></p>
