    <h1>URGENT: SUPPORT SAFER CYCLING IN PORTSMOUTH</h1>
    <p><a href="https://e-activist.com/page/15054/action/1?ea.tracking.id=CLIPS">Portsmouth City Council motion to support City to Share</a>: Tuesday 17 October.</p>
<p>Portsmouth City Council will be considering a motion to support City to Share on Tuesday at their full council meeting.  City to Share is the Portsmouth Cycle Forum document inspired by Leader of the Council Donna Jones’ challenge for us to produce a cycle strategy for the city.</p>
<p>We hope you also support this campaign so we can make Portsmouth a safer place for cycling for all of us now, and for future generations. We need to show how important this is an issue within the city. A properly designed and funded network of cycle routes throughout the city will help to cut congestion and pollution, improve journey times and personal health as it encourages those who believe the city is too unsafe for cycling to switch their preferred method of transport.</p>
<p>We’re calling for Portsmouth City Council to commit to a small percentage of the transport budget devoted to cycling infrastructure, increasing over the years to £20 per head.</p>
