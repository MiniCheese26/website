    <h1>CYCLE TUBE MAP</h1>
    <p>We’ve worked with our members, and Cycling UK, to put together a Cycling Tube Map.</p>
<p>The idea of this map is not for directions – it’s to highlight the quality of cycling links around our city so we can prioritise our campaigning and support members responding to planning applications.<br>The big idea is to turn the map blue (for Pompey of course). Routes marked blue are comfortable, and feel safe to our members. Yellow, orange, red and black show decreasing cycling quality – these are the areas we want to tackle.</p>
<p>Check it out on its <a href="http://www.printsink.co.uk/pcf/cycle-tube-map/">new campaign page</a>. We’ll keep it up to date as infrastructure changes, so let us know if you’ve spotted something that improves, or worsens an existing route.</p>
