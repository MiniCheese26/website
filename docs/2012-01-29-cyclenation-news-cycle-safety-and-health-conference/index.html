    <p><img src="http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/wp-cyclenation-news/cnlogo.jpg" alt="Cyclenation Logo">A  quick heads-up about a conference we're organising  - please put the  date in your group diaries and start thinking about who from your group  might like to go. We'll let you have more details when they're  finalised.</p>
<p>The ogre of cycling danger is constantly with us   in the media, local authorities and other groups, impeding our efforts  to get more people cycling more often.</p>
<p>From Facilities to  Helmets, Networks to Cycling Standards you’ll  know  that the truth gets  trampled.  But rebutting misinformation and criticisms of cycling is  far from easy.</p>
<p>Be under no  illusion we are up against increasingly stiff opposition, despite all  the pro cycling rhetoric and strategies. Ironically much comes  from  quarters which claim to promote cycling oblivious to the fact that  they’re doing exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>To help you  fully  understand the issues, get the facts at your fingertips and ready to  engage locally with the media, councils and others Cyclenation  has  arranged a conference.  We are bringing together a range of experts, not  just from the world of cycling, but also from the likes of the  Transport and Health Study Group, mainly epidemiologists and other  medical professionals .</p>
<p>The full programme is being finalised  but will cover the relative risks associated with cycling together with  the health benefits .It’s important to have at least one delegate from  each Cyclenation group up to speed . They would probably already have  concerns over this  aspect of campaigning, but anyone else  wanting to  gain an understanding would come away far better informed.</p>
<p>It’s free to Cyclenation members and CTC right to ride reps (although  you or your local group will have to fund travel and lunch) .</p>
<p>Time and Place  Saturday 21st April 2012, 10.30 for an 11.00 start to about 4pm  at Carr’s Lane Church Centre Birmingham.</p>
