    <p>I took a walk along Albert Road earlier today - buying gift-wrap for my Mum's birthday as it happens.  As always, Albert Road was choked by illegally parked vehicles.  It always is and I am always shocked by it, but today I decided it was time to start making some noise about it.  In the short walk from the Haslemere Road junction to the King's Theatre area I spotted at least 15 different offending vehicles. It is obvious from the quantity of offending vehicles that motorists consider the chance of being caught and fined to be minute.</p>
<p>I am hoping that if I (and hopefully some other people) start complaining about this then some Community Safety Officers will be tasked to deal with this.  So - next time you walk down Albert Road grab some pics and send them <a href="http://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/living/parking.html" title="PCC Parking Office">PCC's parking office</a>, and to your local Councillor.  That's what I've just done.</p>
