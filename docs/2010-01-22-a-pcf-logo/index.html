  <article>
    <p>Another issue that was discussed at the open meeting on the 14th January was a proposed PCF logo.  This logo was produced for us for free by a professional graphic artist.  The aim was to create a logo that enables instant recognition and would resonate with younger (potential) cyclists.  It is fair to say that the result is a strong design that divided opinion.</p>
<p>As some members were so strongly opposed to the new logo we felt it a good idea to give all members the opportunity to propose a design and then choose a favourite.</p>
