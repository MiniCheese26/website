    <p>As part of Bike Week some of us will be taking part in the Trees ride tomorrow. Loop round Gosport and look</p>
<figure id="attachment_2519" align="alignleft" width="71" caption="Tree in Stanley Park Gosport"][![tree](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/trees1.jpg)](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/2011/06/trees-ride-thursday-at-5-in-the-guildhall/trees-2/)</figure>
<p>at some of the lovely trees en-route then finish off with some of our own fabulous Portsmouth trees. As the Thomas Ellis Owen ride today was so well received and everyone was so interested in John and Sue Pike's commentary we didn't make it as far as Gosport. So it was decided that the trees ride would start with the ferry ride instead. The garden at Alverstoke Crescent is one of the first stops for the trees ride and would have been the last stop for today's TEO ride.</p>
<p>We'll be meeting in the Guildhall Square at 5, hope to see you there. Why not take a look at the trees ride leaflet <a href="http://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/media/Trees_leaflet.pdf" title="trees ride leaflet">here</a></p>
