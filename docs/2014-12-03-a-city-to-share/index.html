<p>On Monday 3rd November Portsmouth Cycle Forum will launch &quot;A City to Share&quot;, its strategy to put safe cycling at the heart of Portsmouth’s transport policy.</p>
<p>The proposal will  be presented to city leaders at a launch event hosted by the University of Portsmouth. It sets out a vision for the city where there is space for cyclists, drivers and pedestrians to co-operate with each other and treat one another with courtesy and respect.</p>
<p>Cllr Donna Jones invited Portsmouth Cycle Forum to propose improvements to transport in the city, following an open letter it wrote to the council in August 2014. The challenge now handed back to all local leaders in the strategy is how to work together to deliver these changes.</p>
<p>&quot;A City to Share&quot; sets out a vision where cyclists and pedestrians who live, work, study and visit Portsmouth can be safely accommodated alongside drivers. The strategy aims to deliver a steep reduction in the number of accidents involving cyclists and pedestrians by changing the way the streets are designed.</p>
<p>This means cost-effective interventions to make cycling a viable alternative to the car as it has in other thriving cities like York, Bristol and Cambridge.</p>
<p>Jon Spencer, Chair of Portsmouth Cycle Forum, comments: “Only about 4.6% of commuting journeys in Portsmouth are made by bike, which is significantly lower than the 16% seen in Cambridge. We believe that with the right infrastructure in place Portsmouth could be an ideal city for cycling, and aim to see the percentage of commuting journeys rise to 10% by 2020, and 20% by 2025.”</p>
<p>&quot;Making changes to the city to enable many more people to cycle safely will benefit everyone. It will bring great benefits to the health, wealth and wellbeing of the whole city. The people of Cambridge are fitter, healthier and longer lived than the people of Portsmouth and we’d like to see Portsmouth catch up.&quot;</p>
<p>Ian McCormack, University of Portsmouth Environment Manager, said “The university supports the initiative of the cycle strategy for the city of Portsmouth, which will benefit students and staff.”</p>
<p>British Cycling’s campaigns manager Martin Key said “British Cycling wants to see more people on bikes. We can inspire people to cycle but what will really make the difference is if we make cycling a more desirable way of getting around. This strategy has the vision and ambition to make to make the city a healthier, happier and more active place to live.”</p>
<p>The strategy focuses on the recognised potential benefits for the community in Portsmouth. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health</strong> - Regular physical activity like cycling for short trips will help address obesity and ensure the people are healthier for longer.</li>
<li><strong>Economy</strong> - Shoppers who mainly visit through walking, cycling or the bus will visit more shops and more frequently supporting local high streets. This relies on addressing road safety to help overcome fears of cycling in Portsmouth. Reducing congestion will benefit all businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Liveability</strong> - Improving safety and reducing traffic along residential roads to support cycling will help children get to school and visit nearby friends. As more people switch from travelling by car to walking or cycling, it will reduce the demand on scarce parking spaces in the city.</li>
<li><strong>Environment</strong> - The primary source of air pollution in Portsmouth is motor traffic. When residents in the city switch from cars to cycling to make short trips, it will help reduce the estimated 600 preventable deaths a year in the city due to air pollution.</li>
</ul>
<p>By working together with residents and businesses in the city, the council can start to address the vision through key practical interventions it can start to deliver immediately such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a cross party sustainable transport working group to oversee delivery of the strategy goals;</li>
<li>Consult on and deliver a cycle safety action plan to address the level of cycle accidents;</li>
<li>Allocate resources to assess the suitability of cycling provision in each neighbourhood to augment the Portsmouth Plan;</li>
<li>Research options to create space for cycling on main routes;</li>
<li>To work with public transport operators in Portsmouth to consult on how to support the increasing number of customers who switch to cycling in the city after disembarking in Portsmouth;</li>
</ul>
<p>The strategy will be presented at a <a href="/2014/10/cycle-forum-open-meeting-13-november/">public meeting of the Portsmouth Cycling Forum</a> on Thursday 13<sup>th</sup> November 2014 in Room 0.08 of Park Building, University of Portsmouth on King Henry I Street.</p>
