<p>On Wednesday 25th June members of the Portsmouth Cycle Forum Committee met with the new leader of Portsmouth City Council, Cllr Donna Jones, and her cabinet member for Traffic &amp; Transportation Cllr Ken Ellcome.</p>
<p>The purpose of the meeting was to ask PCC to develop a strategy for cycling, both to address immediate issues, like the shocking casualty rates on our roads, and a long term plan to develop cycling in the city.  We presented them with copies of the Copenhagen cycle strategy as an example.</p>
<p>Attendees from Portsmouth Cycle Forum were Jon Spencer (chair), John Holland (vice chair), Rich Boakes and Tom Hart (committee members).</p>
<p><strong>Points &amp; Actions Arising</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Donna Jones seemed very taken by the Copenhagen Strategy brochure and was keen that PCC should have a Cycling Strategy. Also, that this should be meaningful, not window dressing. She hoped Ken Ellcome would agree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She said she intended meeting the mayor of Bristol at a forthcoming conference, to discuss Bristol's experience. She said it was a subject she knew little about. <strong>Action: Cllr Donna Jones.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ken Ellcome said he would add it (cycling strategy) to his to-do list (along with 30,000 other items).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ken Ellcome noted the electoral position of car owners and the perceived intransigent nature of the Portsmouth road network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He did, however, say he was pushing through a cycle lane on the north side of Havant Rd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He also said he was happy to consider quick-win cycling safety suggestions from PCF, provided these were not expensive. <strong>Action:PCF, if we wish</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We discussed last Strategy doc (to 2010) and we offered to review this and suggest to Ken parts that could be included again. This was welcomed. <strong>Action:PCF</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also agreed to provide details of Waltham Forest, Hackney and other London boroughs that were forward-thinking on cycling. <strong>Action:PCF</strong>.
<strong>Observations and Conclusions</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donna Jones is clearly interested in launching a new Cycling Strategy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At same time, she seemed serious in agreeing that it needed to be a credible piece of work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ken Ellcome, as he said, has a lot of competing interests clamouring for his attention, plus taking actions on cyclists' behalf is guaranteed to give him a headache from motor vehicle users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, our lobbying and use of the Press, needs to be continuous and high-profile, to keep councillors focused on addressing the Cycling Safety agenda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overall, a good meeting, with initial positioning achieved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
