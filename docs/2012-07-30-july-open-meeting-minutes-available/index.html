    <p>Our open meeting on 12 July was at Wiggle in Southampton Road where we learned about the history of the company from its roots at Butler’s Cycles in Southsea to its current position as one of the UKs leading on-line cycle retailers. We were able to see the extensive workshop facilities where bikes are built and assembled for customers around the world. We’d like to thank Wiggle very much for their hospitality. Minutes of the meeting are available to download <a href="http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/PCF-Open-Meeting-12Jul12-MINUTES.pdf" title="Minutes of the PCF Open Meeting 12 July 2012 ">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please mark Thursday 13 September in your diaries for the next Cycle Forum open meeting which will be at 7pm at the Stacey Community Centre in Copnor. Details will be available nearer the time but the <a href="http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/community-cycle-centre/" title="Community">Community Cycle Centre</a>, based at the Stacey, will be open for your inspection!</p>
