National Bike Week, the UK’s biggest mass participation cycling event, will be taking place between 16 – 24 June 2012.</p>
<p>Registration for Bike Week events opens at the end of February. Please visit <a href="http://www.bikeweek.org.uk/">www.bikeweek.org.uk</a> for further information.</p>
<p>Bike Week began as a grass-roots organisation in 1923, and provides a national umbrella for locally organised events and activities up and down the UK. In 2011, almost half a million participants took part in almost 2,000 events across the UK.</p>
<p>In recent years Bike Week has benefited from sponsorship from Nokia, and most recently, been a headline event in EDF Energy’s Team Green Britain campaign. In 2012, the event is currently seeking a sponsor and other commercial partners, but the support from the cycle industry (via Bike Hub) and Transport for London has enabled Bike Week to carry on hosting this nationwide event.</p>
