  <article>
    <p>The Northern Quarter is the name given to the proposed retail development to the north of Portsmouth City Centre which includes the site of the former Tricorn Centre.</p>
<p>Portsmouth Cycle Forum consider the proposed changes to the road layout in the plan by developers Centros do not provide sufficient access for cyclists.</p>
<p>Some simple, cost-effective changes could be made to give a serious boost to cycling in the city, improve the environment, reduce traffic congestion and help make this a fitter, healthier city.</p>
<p>The current scheme gives little incentive to anyone to get out of their cars and onto their bikes.</p>
<p>We have produced two documents which detail the shortcomings together with our proposals for improvements.</p>
<p>With Centros currently re-designing the scheme, there exists an ideal opportunity to make changes for the better.</p>
