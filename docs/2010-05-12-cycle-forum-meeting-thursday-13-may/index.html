  <article>
    <p>This month we'll be looking back to the conference and asking the question : Portsmouth - A Future Cycling City?</p>
<p>Jon Spencer will repeat his much-acclaimed talk which, if you've not seen, will make you laugh and think!</p>
<p>We'll be asking YOU what you want us to look at over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Also a new government will have different priorities and we want to make sure that cycling is one of them.</p>
<p>And finally, there's that new cycle path which has created ripples in Eastney and Craneswater. What's your view? How would you like to see the phase 2 section built?</p>
<p>Venue: Meeting Room 1, 3rd Floor, Guildhall.
Starts at 19:00, duration is 02:00 hours.</p>
