<p>Dear Andre,</p>
<p>Thank you for your letter of Wednesday 19 October 2011 suggesting a meeting to discuss cycling issues.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to support sustainable travel, including walking and cycling, as set out in the Coalition agreement. We have made available £560m over the next 4 years for projects under the local sustainable transport fund and have committed to support Bikeability cycle training for the remainder of this parliament.</p>
<p>As you know, we have also created a national Cycling Forum, chaired by Norman Baker MP. Thank you for your involvement in this forum, and I hope you will continue to contribute in the future. I believe the group will play and important role in bringing all interested parties together to discuss real action towards our shared goal of promoting cycling as a safe, healthy and green travel choice.</p>
<p>I assure you I will keep touch with Norman Baker on relevant issues from this group and I wish you luck on your on-going work.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Justine Greening</p>
<p>So that’ll be a ‘No thanks’ then?</p>
