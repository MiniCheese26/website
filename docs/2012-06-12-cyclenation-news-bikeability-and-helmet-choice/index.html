    <p><img src="http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/wp-cyclenation-news/cnlogo.jpg" alt="Cyclenation Logo"><p>Building on our recent seminar, we are also interested in how many Local Authority organised schemes offer a helmet choice.</p>
<p>This is taken from the <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/bikeability/wp-content/uploads/Health_and_Safety_Policy_Guidance.pdf" title="H and S guidance">Health and Safety policy guidance for Bikeability cycle training</a>....</p>
<ul>
<li>It is recommended that children wear cycle helmets during training. If helmets are worn, instructors may need to adjust them to obtain a better fit.</li>
<li>Adults may decide for themselves whether or not to wear a helmet, but instructorsshould explain the benefits and state that the Road Safety Unit recommends that they wear one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does you local authority insist on helmet wearing for their bikeability courses? or do they offer a choice?</p>
<p>Take a look at the national<a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/bikeability" title="bikeability"> website </a>and see if you can find an image that doesn't show cyclists with helmets on.....</p>
