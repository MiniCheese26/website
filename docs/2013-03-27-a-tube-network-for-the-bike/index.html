<p>Cycle routes named after tube lines, better cycling infrastructure and increases to cycle parking at mainline stations are some of the proposals in the Mayor of London's Cycling Vision which was released in March.</p>
<p>The Vision has been developed in consultation with cycling groups with an accompanying budget of £913m. The vision focuses on high-quality segregated infrastructure, including a central East-West route.</p>
<p>New routes parallel to and named after Tube routes, such as the 'Bakerloo Superhighway' will be built, as well as 'Quietways' using back-streets. In addition, 'mini-Hollands' are proposed for outer London, with redesigned town centres, cycle hubs at railway stations, and a cycle route to central London.</p>
<p>The document points to the success of 'filtered permeability' in Hackney, where streets have been transformed into high quality cycle routes through closing roads to motor traffic, but retaining cycle access.</p>
<p>Plans for new infrastructure will also focus on junctions - where 75% of cycle casualties occur and some 20mph limits will be introduced.</p>
<p>Other measures include a new 'Superhub', with space for thousands of bikes to be parked and hundreds of hire bikes available, which will be constructed at one of the mainline stations. The cycle hire scheme will also be extended, increasing the number of bikes available to 11,000.</p>
<p>Thus is breathtakingly ambitious plan - particularly compared with the national picture. The document can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/publication/mayors-vision-cycling" title="Boris">www.london.gov.uk/publication/mayors-vision-cycling</a>.</p>
