Do you want to explore the best route? Do you want to make new cycling friends? Do you want to find out how to keep your wheels turning?</p>
<p>Join us with your bike to <span style="color: #333300;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Cycle Friday</span></strong></span>, at Cosham Station on June 25th at 7.30am where bike buddies from Portsmouth Cycle Forum will lead you to the City Centre and Gunwharf Quays.</p>
<p>Cyclists can join or leave **<span style="color: #008000;">Cycle Friday</span> **anywhere along the route which will pass the Mountbatten Centre and Continental Ferry Port using cycle routes throughout. The pace will be tailored to suit.</p>
<p>Whether you're new to cycling, returning to your bike after a break, or cycle every day, celebrate midsummer with an early morning cycle ride to work. PCF bike buddies will also offer a return ride by the same route in the evening leaving Gunwharf Quays at 4.30pm, back to Cosham at 5.45pm.</p>
<p>John Holland Cycle Forum Chairman said “This is a great opportunity to try out commuting by bicycle.  Cycle Friday is a regular event in other cities and we thought we’d try it out for Bike Week in Portsmouth“.</p>
