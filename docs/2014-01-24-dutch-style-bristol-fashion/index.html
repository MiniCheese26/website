<p>We have our next open meeting on Thursday 13 February at 7pm at the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview/place/university+of+portsmouth+su/@50.7945485,-1.0963502,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x48745d9ca4d71053:0x7474561a9c6fef4e?hl=en" title="Meeting location">Student Union building on Cambridge Road</a>.</p>
<p>At our last meeting we looked at how the Dutch have created cycle-friendly towns and cities.  Thank you to everyone who attended – we hope you enjoyed it and came away more positive about the future of cycling in Portsmouth.  As a follow-up, we’ll be looking at how we can do this in the UK and in Portsmouth in particular.</p>
<p>We’ll be joined by <strong>Eric Booth, chair of the cycle campaign in Bristol</strong>, which became the UK’s first ‘cycling city’ in 2008.  They’ve had a number of infrastructure improvements since, and now have ambitions to create their own Dutch-style cycle network of segregated lanes and tracks.</p>
<p>Can we do this in Portsmouth? Or is it too ambitious?  As an example of ambition, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/auto-ban-how-hamburg-is-taking-cars-off-the-road-9062461.html" title="Hamburg to Ban Cars">Hamburg – Germany’s second largest city – is planning to ban all cars from its city centre within 20 years</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Roger Geffen, the CTC's national campaigns and policy director</strong> will also be speaking about best practice from across the land. Once again we will finish with a Q&amp;A session with our guests plus Cllr Jason Fazackarley, the PCC cabinet member for Traffic &amp; Transportation.</p>
