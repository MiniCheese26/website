## Concepts

Several concepts underpin this site; keep them in mind when developing.

0. **Extend**.  This list is incomplete and inexhaustive.  Adding to it is good, so long as it's a high-level concept that can be easily grokked. 

1. **Mobile first**.  Our primary platform for readers is the mobile phone, so improvements to the UI should always focus on those users first, and their experience should not be diminished by unnecessarily focusing on desktop development.

2. **Encourage Discovery**.  We want people who find an article that's relevent to be easily able to discover other articles.  For this tags are key.  Careful maintenance of tags can help build useful paths across the site.

3. **Colours and Affordance**.  Generally speaking aim for the concept that if it's orange it's a hyperlink to somewhere useful and an be clicked.
