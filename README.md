## Concepts

Several concepts underpin this site; keep them in mind when developing.

1. **Mobile first**.  Our primary platform for readers is the mobile phone, so improvements to the UI shoudl always focus on those users first, and their experience should not be diminished by unnecessarily focusing on desktop development.

2. **Encourage Discovery**.  We want people who find an article that's relevent to be easily able to discover other articles.  For this tags are key.  Careful maintenance of tags can help build useful paths across the site.

3. **Colours**.  Generally speaking if it's orange, you can click it.
