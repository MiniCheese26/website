    <p>Membership of Portsmouth Cycle Forum is <strong>free</strong>, because we want to encourage as many cyclists as we can to engage with our campaign. However, any campaign has some costs and the cycle forum is no different.</p>
<p>If you’d like to make a donation to support our campaign we would very, very much appreciate your generosity. This will help us to cover costs such as printing, postage, event fees and web-related fees.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://pay.sumup.io/b2c/QHGTB2DU">donate to us via <em>Sumup</em></a> using any credit or debit card.  We understand that money is tight and we genuinely appreciate every penny.</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>
