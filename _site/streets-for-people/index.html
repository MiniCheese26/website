    <p>Our friends at Portsmouth Friends of the Earth have just published <a href="https://portsmouthfoe.org/2019/03/25/streets-for-people-report/">this report</a> that sets out local people’s vision for Portsmouth streets as places that are people-friendly and not dominated by cars.</p>
<p>The report is based on comments from local people about their favourite streets, the horrors of others, and ideas for making their neighbourhood streets places where they want to walk, cycle, play, chat and sit.</p>
<p>They’ve passed this report to Portsmouth City Council in order to inform the new City Plan to create a safer and more pleasant city. We think it sits very nicely alongside our “A City to Share” strategy document which you can find <a href="http://acitytoshare.org/">here.</a></p>
