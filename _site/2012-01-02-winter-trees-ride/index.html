  <article>
    <p>This coming Sunday, 8th January, is the first group ride of the year.<a href="http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/2012/01/winter-trees-ride/trees-jpeg-2/"><img src="http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/trees-jpeg1-221x300.jpg" alt="trees ride poster"></a>
An easy paced look at the trees of Gosport and an attempt to identify them without any leaves on.</p>
<p>Our rides are for anyone that wants to come along and enjoy a bit of sociable cycling.
The pace of the ride depends on the riders, the distances are manageable and the routes follow quiet, low traffic roads and cycle ways and are designed to appeal to a wide range of people including families and less confident riders.
We will meet at the Gosport ferry at 11 and hope to be back by 2.
An excellent way to start the new year and reduce the impact of some of those little Christmas excesses!</p>
