<p><strong>Southsea Seafront Cyclist fatality – Statement from Portsmouth Cycle Forum</strong>
Portsmouth Cycle Forum is very sad to learn of the death in a road accident of a woman cyclist at Clarence Esplanade on Saturday 17 July. Our thoughts lie with her family and friends to whom send our deepest condolences.</p>
<p>The cyclist was involved in collision with a bus in the vicinity of Pier Road and Clarence Esplanade, close to Clarence Pier.</p>
<p>This terrible accident is yet another reminder that large vehicles, busy traffic and cyclists are not a happy mix. Whilst it will be some time before the details are made public, we urge the Portsmouth City Council to press ahead with making this section of our seafront much safer and calmer for all.</p>
<p>Almost exactly one year ago, a cyclist was seriously injured Clarence Esplanade when a car reversed blindly from a parking bay into the road.</p>
<p>Portsmouth City Council is on the verge of postponing Phase 2 of the Southsea Seafront Cycle Route. Had this been in place yesterday then this awful incident might have been avoided.</p>
<p>We urge councillors to think again. A safe and segregated cycle route can be built – one which doesn’t lose any car parking, one which doesn’t stop people looking out to sea from their cars, one which doesn’t involve cycling on the promenade. We will be pushing hard for this - we don’t want any more injuries and fatalities on our seafront roads.</p>
<p>John Holland, Chairman, Portsmouth Cycle Forum.</p>
