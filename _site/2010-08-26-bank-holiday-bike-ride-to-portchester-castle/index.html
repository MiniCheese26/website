<p>Portsmouth Cycle Forum in association with Healthy Pompey is organising a family bike ride to Portchester Castle on Bank Holiday Sunday 29 August.</p>
<p>The 12 mile route (6 miles each way)  is flat and will be mostly on cycle paths with just a little on-road riding.</p>
<p>Starting at 10am in Victoria Park, we'll take the cycle path out towards Mountbatten Centre, then along the foreshore to Hilsea, past IBM and Tesco Northarbour to Portchester. We'll keep to the pace of those at the back, with a leader and tail guide.</p>
<p>In Portchester you can visit the remains of the castle built by William the Conqueror on the site of a Roman fort (English Heritage charges for entry). Or just look around the castle grounds and take in the great view of the harbour towards Portsmouth and Gosport – for free. We'll spend about 30 minutes there but if you want to stay longer you can make your own way back.</p>
<p>We plan to return to Victoria Park by about 1pm.</p>
