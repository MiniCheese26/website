    <p>The Annual General Meeting in Birmingham was attended by Jayne Rodgers and John Holland who represented Portsmouth Cycle Forum. Cyclenation is the federation of cycle campaign groups across the UK.</p>
<p><strong>Cyclenation achievements 2012 - 2013.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cyclenation kept the UK Cycling Alliance, UKCA, together when it was in danger of falling apart. Without this, the co-ordinated approach that led to the Parliamentary Enquiry would not have been possible. For the time in many years the national cycling organisations are speaking with one voice.</li>
<li>Another successful Bike Week was held with a link up with Samsung. The 2013 event runs from 15 to 23 June.</li>
<li>Cyclenation worked with the Dutch Cycling Embassy and the Bristol and Manchester campaigns as well as Cycling Scotland on delivering a series of three conferences. These followed from a conference organised jointly between the Dutch Embassy and London Cycle Campaign.</li>
<li>The annual campaign conference was in Bristol with some innovative ideas from the local group that helped to ensure a memorable event.</li>
<li>Web site development has been the major project this year and it will be fully re-launched shortly after the AGM.</li>
<li>Cyclenation won funding for a national publication, <em>Cycling in New Developments</em>, addressing a gap in advice that many groups have identified in their dealings with development control.</li>
<li>The board continues to visit as many groups as possible and the offer to visit is always there.</li>
<li>Cyclenation conducted a fundamental review of its development plan.</li>
<li>A policy paper on infrastructure was produced this year for local groups to use for campaign development.</li>
<li>The major campaigns are a twin track approach with one broader theme: a campaign for cycle friendly communities, and a more specific campaign on one way streets.</li>
<li>In the coming year the board will need to focus on building capacity, work with the other members of the  UKCA to agree on what we do following the parliamentary enquiry and report, and encourage groups to maximise the new opportunities for local campaigning.</li>
<li>The existing board was re-elected “as is” (including Jayne Rodgers from Portsmouth). There is a vacancy for one co-opted Board member. If you are interested in helping please get in touch.
<strong>Cycling parliament</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The formal part of the meeting was followed by a Cycling Parliament where issues relating to cycle campaigning in the UK were discussed with a view to developing ideas for activities in the coming year. Priorities include representation, the provision of services &amp; tools,  running conferences &amp; Seminars and providing information to member groups. Campaign themes include building a nation of cycle friendly communities and two way cycling in one way streets. Cyclenation will be issuing guidance on assessing the Economic and Health benefits of cycling using the World Health Organisation’s Health Economic Assessment Tool (HEAT) for Cycling and Walking.</p>
