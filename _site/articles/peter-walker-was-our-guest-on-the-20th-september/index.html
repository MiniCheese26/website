<p>We’re delighted to announce that our guest speaker at our Open Meeting on the 20th September was Peter Walker. His book <a href="https://pompeybug.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2ed916007f1c294faa614a50f&amp;id=46dba720c3&amp;e=140d2bad5a">Bike Nation: How Cycling Can Save the World</a> takes us on a journey around the world, exploring the varying attitudes to cycling on our highways.</p>
<p>Visit the shining examples of Amsterdam and Copenhagen, where cycling culture is an intrinsic part of the approach of politicians and officials. How have these cities made provision for cyclists and what are the extraordinary benefits?</p>
<p>And then take to the less welcoming roads of Britain, USA and Australia, where cycling can still be a terrifying experience. What are the tragic mistakes being made when planning and developing cities, and how do these mistakes lead to aggression towards the cycling community?</p>
<p>Peter is Political Correspondent for the Guardian. In 2009 he set up the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog">Guardian Bike Blog</a> which has published dozens of writers and has quickly become a primary destination for cycling debate. In 2014 he was named by BikeBizmagazine as one of the 50 most influential people in UK cycling, and in 2016 he was shortlisted in the Specialist Writer category at the Cycling Media Awards.</p>
<p>Greater Manchester Walking and Cycling Commissioner and former professional cyclist Chris Boardman says “Peter Walker has written the book I wanted to write”</p>
