<p>Our aim is to bring you up to speed with all the current projects in development whether they are being funded through the <a href="https://travel.portsmouth.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Local-Transport-Plan-2021.pdf">Local Transport Plan</a>, <a href="https://www.sehrt.org.uk/schemes/">South East Hants Rapid Transit projects</a> or are being developed through the wider regeneration of the city.  We hope to have time for some questions, but some of us will probably retire to a local hostelry to discuss the issues raised, if you want to continue the conversation.</p>
<p>We aim to start promptly at 7pm on Thursday 26th January and will finish at 8:45pm. We are returning to the University's Richmond Building.
