<p>A report from traffic consultants Steer Davies Greave puts Portsmouth high on the list of English towns and cities with cycling potential. The Cycling Potential Index (CPI) ranks the towns and cities in England and Wales by their underlying attractiveness for cycling in terms of terrain, demographics and travel patterns.</p>
<p>The CPI can be used to help devise strategies for cycling for a whole town or city, or at a much more local level. For towns and cities near the bottom of the ranking this could help to overcome some of the inherent challenges faced.</p>
<p>For those fortunate enough to be nearer the top, the question is more about exploiting the underlying potential - and Portsmouth certainly has that.</p>
