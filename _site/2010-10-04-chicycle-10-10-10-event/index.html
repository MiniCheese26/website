<p>10-10-10 is a world-wide day for global action on the environment (see <a href="http://www.350.org/">http://www.350.org/</a> for more info).  <a href="http://chicycle.org.uk/">Chichester Cycle Campaign</a> are staging an event to draw attention to the fact that cycling is a more environmentally friendly way to get from A to B.</p>
<p>They are holding an event at the Cross in Chichester at noon on that Sunday and are giving away 10 10-10 tags to the first 10 cyclists who turn up.  Participants can then either take part in a 10 mile ride or cycle 10 times round the city walls or just join in the photo and cycle home at their leisure.</p>
<p>ChiCycle will be handing out their 20's Plenty petitions and hope that people will be able to get 10 signatures each as part of their contribution to this global day.  <a href="http://www.20splentyforus.org.uk/">20's Plenty </a>is a campaign to make residential streets safer for all vulnerable road users especially children and old people, pedestrians and cyclists.</p>
