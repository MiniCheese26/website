  <article>
    <p>The traffic calming scheme in Albert Road by the Kings Theatre is largely completed and we are seeking views of cyclists on whether you like it or not.</p>
<p>Kerbs have been dropped to blur the distinction between pavement and carriageway with the intention of giving the road a relaxed &quot;continental&quot; appeal.</p>
<p>Coloured and stainless-steel bollards stop vehicles encroaching into pedestrian areas. These have been enlarged to allow more space for tables and chairs outside shops, pubs and cafes.</p>
<p>Generally, space has been reclaimed for pedestrians from the motor car - not a bad thing (well cyclists would say that, wouldn't they!).</p>
<p>The taxi rank has been moved back along Albert Road and some on-street car parking has been removed.</p>
<p>So, what do you think?</p>
<p>Some cyclists have expressed concern that the roadway is narrower than before and that they feel that they are being pushed into the the path of vehicles.</p>
<p>Others have noticed an increase in pavement cycling (or more correctly, cycling in the pedestrian areas).</p>
<p>It has been suggested that a marked cycle lane should be created on the pedestrian side of the bollards in the narrowest sections.</p>
<p>We would like to see the imposition of a 20mph speed limit in this part (and all parts) of albert Road.</p>
