    <h1>How to hire a cargo bike in Portsmouth</h1>
<p>In 2021 following a successful Crowdfunder initiated by Southsea Cycles, Sustrans and Portsmouth Climate Action Board, a Community Cargo Project was born. The project aims to make electric cargo bikes available to hire at a low cost so that more people can access the benefits of cargo biking. The funds raised allowed the purchase of two electric cargo bikes. A Babboe Curve trike is now available to try out while second one – a Babboe City Mountain two-wheeler is coming soon.</p>
<h2>What you can hire:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Electric Babboe Curve – three-wheeler box bike perfect to transport large weekly shopping or up to 4 children. Benches are equipped with four three-point harnesses. A rain cover can be requested for riding in wet weather. Front box loading capacity is 100 kg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coming soon - Electric Babboe City Mountain – two-wheeler cargo bike which can accommodate up to two children or your weekly grocery shop. Front box loading capacity is 80 kg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessories such as helmets and locks are also available to hire in the shop, just ask.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Top tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Grab a blanket for your passengers if riding in colder weather, they will appreciate it</li>
<li>Take it easy if this is your first time, practice makes perfect</li>
<li>You may be surprised to notice that some drivers will give you more space, that is the cargo bike effect!</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy cargo bike riding!</p>
