    <p>Introduction</p>
<p>These are the accounts for Portsmouth Cycle Forum, financial year ending 28 February 2014.</p>
<h1>Accounts</h1>
<p>Income:  Our regular income solely relies on subscriptions from paid-up members, with occasional one-off donations.</p>
<p>Members:  There has been a decrease in paid membership for this year – down to 36 from 39 the previous year.</p>
<p>Costs: Without a regular ‘free’ venue at the Guildhall we now have costs for holding meetings.  We are grateful to Mario and the University of Portsmouth Students Union for the use of their meeting room free of charge for our last two meetings.  Previously in the last year we made use of free community spaces but these were poorly attended.  The UPSU room was not available today and we have a £50 charge for the hire of this hall.  Other regular costs are for printing, website hosting and subscriptions for national cycling bodies.</p>
<p>Subscriptions:   For the next year membership subscriptions will remain at £5 (with no fee for concessions).  Renewals can be made by cheque, cash or through Paypal via the Pompeybug website.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Important Note</span>:  We need to make a serious effort to convert subscribers on our mailing list to paid-up members.  If we are to make use of central locations we need to increase the number of membership subscriptions and donations to offset the costs.  Additional income will allow the Forum to expand its activities through promotion.</p>
