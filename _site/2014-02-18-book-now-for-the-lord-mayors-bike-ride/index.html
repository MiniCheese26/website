    <p>Bookings are open for the Lord Mayor's Charity Bike Ride which takes place on Sunday 23 March from Victoria Park in central Portsmouth.</p>
<p>Entrants can choose from a selection of two rides depending on ability; the Half Island Ride is a fun bike ride for all the family to enjoy, or for the more advanced cyclists, the Full Island Ride which takes in spectacular views along the coast.</p>
<p>All proceeds form the ride will be donated to the Lord Mayor's Appeal fund which, this year, is supporting Brain Tumour Research, Portsmouth Young Carers and the Baffins Pond Association.</p>
<p>Wiggle have kindly donated a £500 state-of-the-art bike as a prize. The lucky winner will be selected from entrants who manage to raise more than £50 sponsorship.</p>
<p>Portsmouth Cycle Exchange have also kindly donated two bikes that will be awarded to the 'best dressed rider' and the person who raises the most sponsorship money.</p>
<p>Portsmouth Cycle is helping with the event providing marshals and we will be having a stall at the start/finish.</p>
<p>For further details of the rides and to register please visit: <a href="http://www.myjourneyportsmouth.com/lordmayorsbikeride">www.myjourneyportsmouth.com/lordmayorsbikeride</a>.</p>
