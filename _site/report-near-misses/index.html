    <h2>Report Near Misses!</h2>
<p>Examples of a near miss are, being passed too close, another vehicle pulling in or out across a cyclist’s path, being driven at, and a near left or right hook.</p>
<p>This list is not exhaustive however, and what qualifies as a near miss may differ from one cyclist to another – depending on experience and level of confidence. We encourage you to report any incident you feel was a near miss.</p>
<p>Please follow this <a href="https://my.portsmouth.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-7387ee8d-b190-488a-b0ec-1caa3ce0f255/AF-Stage-0a4949c7-1d6d-4ee2-9812-32514a312b7c/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen"><strong>link</strong></a> to Portsmouth City Council’s Near Miss reporting tool.</p>
