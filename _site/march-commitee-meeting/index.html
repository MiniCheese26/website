  <article>
    <p>Talk of the incoming clean air zone led most of the discussion at this month’s committee meeting. Whilst we are very supportive of the idea of a chargeable zone for polluting vehicles, members are concerned that the new zone will push motor traffic onto surrounding roads which are already congested and scary to cycle on. Fratton Road is one of these, so is Elm Grove. We will be asking PCC to ensure before and after monitoring is undertaken to track changes in traffic flow and, crucially, also count the numbers of people walking and cycling, to see if the scheme has put people off.</p>
<p>An update on the Shipwrights Way was given, after one of the committee met PCC for a socially distanced site visit to go through plans to finally finish the 48 mile long distance cycle route which ends at The Hard.</p>
<p>Our next AGM has been set for 22nd April - so save the date and we will share further details soon, although given the continuing pandemic restrictions it will be a virtual, rather than in person event. If you’re interested in getting involved, please do get in touch. We’re particularly looking to increase the diversity of the committee and will be proposing a motion change to our constitution to this effect. We want to represent everyone who cycles, or wants to cycle in our fine city.</p>
<p>We are also continuing to monitor the progress of various schemes currently under development through recent funding awards. The improvements along Goldsmith Avenue have a funding allocation in the 2021/22 Local Transport Plan implementation to be discussed at the March Traffic and Transportation cabinet decision meeting. As with all new schemes funded and designed since the introduction of <a href="https://www.pompeybug.co.uk/tim-p-ltn-1-20-slides-open-meeting-01-21/"><strong>LTN1/20</strong></a>, our main focus is on quality over quantity in order to break the cycle of implementing infrastructure that does not promote the key elements of directness, connectivity, safety, comfort and ease of use for all who wish to cycle.</p>
